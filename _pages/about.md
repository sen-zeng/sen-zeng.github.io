I am a 4th year economics Ph.D. Candidate at Cornell University, I am also affilated with Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy at Cornell. 

My research interests lie in the intersection of industrial organization and econometrics, with applications primarily in health economics. 

I am under the supervision of Francesca Molinari, Levon Barseghyan, and Colleen Carey.
