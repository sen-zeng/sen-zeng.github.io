I am a 4th year economics Ph.D. candidate at Cornell University, I am also affiliated with the Jeb. E Brooks School of Public Policy at Cornell.

My research interests lie in the intersection of industrial organization and econometrics, with applications primarily in health economics.

I am supervised by Francesca Molinari, Levon Barseghyan, and Colleen Carey.
