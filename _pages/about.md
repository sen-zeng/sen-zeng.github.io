I am a 5th-year economics Ph.D. candidate at Cornell University, I am also affiliated with the Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy at Cornell.

My research interests lie in the intersection of industrial organization and econometrics, with applications primarily in health economics.

I am supervised by Professor Francesca Molinari, Professor Levon Barseghyan, and Professor Colleen Carey.

Abstract: The Food and Drug Administration has proposed to prohibit menthol cigarettes, which are smoked by almost 19 million people. Illegal markets for menthol cigarettes could not only blunt the prohibition’s intended consequence to reduce smoking but could also lead to unintended consequences. We use data from a discrete choice experiment to estimate a mixed logit model which predicts that the prohibition of menthol cigarettes would substantially increase the fraction of menthol smokers who attempt to quit tobacco product use. However, our model also predicts substantial potential consumer demand for illegal menthol cigarettes, especially if menthol e-cigarettes are also illegal.

Abstract: Australia had adopted a novel approach to e-cigarette policy by requiring a physician’s prescription to lawfully obtain nicotine e-cigarettes. We conducted an online discrete choice experiment to gauge how adult Australian smokers made hypothetical choices between cigarettes, prescription e-cigarettes, non-prescription e-cigarettes, and quitting. We estimate a mixed logit model, which allows us to predict the market shares under different policy scenarios. The mixed logit model also provides estimates of consumer willingness to pay for the benefits from the prescription status of e-cigarettes and the costs of illegal e-cigarette markets. We estimate that the average utility loss from an illegal retail market is worth AU$ 7.90 per pack-equivalent. We use the corresponding estimates of the compensating variations in income to conduct cost-benefit analyses of possible reforms to Australian e-cigarette regulation. In aggregate, we estimate that the benefits of allowing but not requiring prescriptions of e-cigarettes are AU$1.8 billion per year. Our paper provides a novel contribution to research on e-cigarette regulation and provides a case study for the policy implementation in Australia. Our paper is also part of our research agenda to explore and develop methods to conduct policy analysis and cost-benefit analysis of regulatory policies that might create illegal markets.

**Fear or Knowledge? The Impact of Graphic Cigarette Warnings on Tobacco Product Choices** \

Abstract: Requiring graphic warning labels (GWLs) on cigarette packaging has become a highly contentious unresolved legal battle. The constitutionality depends, in part, on the likely impact of GWLs on smoking decisions, and whether they generate knowledge as opposed to emotional reactions against smoking. Using an online discrete choice stated preference experiment we compare tobacco choices (cigarettes, e-cigarettes, quitting) for those presented with a GWL versus the currently existing label. We find the fraction of individuals choosing cigarettes to be lower and quitting higher for the GWL group. Our findings reveal that the differences between groups were primarily driven by the evocation of fear and disgust rather than an improvement in health knowledge related to the GWL. The discrete choice experiment also provides new evidence on how cigarette prices, e-cigarette prices, and policy-manipulable e-cigarette attributes such as e-cigarette warning labels, and flavor availability influence tobacco product choices.
